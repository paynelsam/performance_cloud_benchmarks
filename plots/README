The scripts in this directory were used to generate the charts shown
in the Performance Cloud Servers blog post announcement. They use data
which was averaged across the six runs of each of the benchmarks they're
testing per server type. The plots are created by plot.ly,
a collaborative data analysis and graphing tool that exposes a simple API
to create these charts.

For example, a script like `plot_pypy.py` simply has three numbers in it.
Each of those results is the average of those six runs for each type of
server, gathered manually, and averaged via Google Spreadsheet.

Currently, there's no easy way to regenerate these plots if you were to run
the benchmarks on your own. This is something we'd love to add in order
to make the end-to-end benchmarking process more smooth.
